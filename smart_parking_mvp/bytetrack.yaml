# ByteTrack Configuration for Smart Parking System
# Optimized for MAXIMUM ID stability - prevents ID changes

tracker_type: bytetrack      # Use ByteTrack algorithm
track_high_thresh: 0.2       # Lower = keep tracks even with lower confidence
track_low_thresh: 0.1        # Second-stage threshold for recovery
new_track_thresh: 0.6        # Higher = harder to create new tracks (reduces duplicate IDs)
track_buffer: 120            # Keep lost tracks for 120 frames (~8 seconds at 15fps)
match_thresh: 0.6            # Lower = more lenient matching (easier to re-identify)
fuse_score: True             # Fuse detection score with IoU for stable matching
